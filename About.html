    <h1> Goals Of Education.</h1>

    <section class="goals">
        <h3 class="heading">Think positive to stay focused </h3>
        <p>Positive thinking can make it easier for you to focus on tasks that need to be done and learn new
            information.For instance, if you approach learning better writing skills with a positive mindset, you may be
            more likely tostay focused since you're open to the experience.</p>
    </section>


    <section class="goals">
        <h3 class="heading"> Stay resilient</h3>
        <p>Resiliency refers to the ability to adapt after encountering a challenge. It's important to acknowledge the
            challenge or difficulty in order to find a way to overcome it. Resiliency helps you accept the issue and
            find steps to move past it while staying positive.</p>
    </section>


    <section class="goals">
        <h3 class="heading">Make time to read</h3>
        <p>Reading can help you to develop critical thinking skills, which are important to make well-reasoned
            decisions. Reading requires you to think and process information in ways you may not experience in other
            forms of entertainment. You can read fiction, autobiographies or journals on any topic that interests you.
            While you read, take notes to keep your mind focused on the text.</p>
    </section>


    <section class="goals">
        <h3 class="heading"> Manage your time</h3>
        <p>Good time-management skills help you to prioritize tasks so youâ€™re able to complete work and assignments on
            time. You should also plan ahead, set aside the time you need for assignments and projects and stay focused
            to better use that time.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="goals">
        <h3 class="heading">Find time to relax</h3>
        <p>Finding time to relax can help you to stay focused and motivated. Giving yourself time to do something you
            enjoy or practice self-care can help instill balance in your life. When you take a break, you can usually
            return to your task with a renewed focus and a fresh perspective.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="goals">
        <h3 class="heading">Strive for excellence</h3>
        <p>You should strive for excellence in your work by setting and then exceeding goals. Excellence is about
            striving to be better, with the end goal of providing consistent quality work. To achieve excellence in your
            day to day, you need to spend time practicing and developing new skills.</p>
    </section>


    <section class="goals">
        <h3 class="heading">Build a strong network</h3>
        <p>Networking is about building and nurturing long-term relationships with the people you meet. When you invest
            time in building meaningful relationships (personal and professional) you create a network of people you can
            rely on throughout your career.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="goals">
        <h3 class="heading">Build good study habits</h3>

            maintaining good study habits can help you to increase your competence, confidence and self-esteem.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="goals">
        <h3 class="heading">Attend seminars or training</h3>

            an ideal opportunity for you to study a topic in-depth. By asking questions, paying attention to the speaker
            and writing notes, you can leave a seminar with a wide range of knowledge in a specific field.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="goals">
        <h3 class="heading">Develop patience to achieve your goals</h3>
        <p>Being patient can help you realize that consistent reflection and hard work can produce successful outcomes.
